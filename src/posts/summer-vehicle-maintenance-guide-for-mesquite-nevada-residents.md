*With Mesquite temperatures regularly exceeding 100°F during summer months, preparing your vehicle for extreme heat is crucial. Get your car ready before the peak temperatures arrive with this comprehensive maintenance guide.*

## Why Mesquite's Climate Demands Special Attention

Mesquite's unique desert climate, with summer temperatures often reaching 110°F, puts exceptional stress on vehicles. The combination of intense heat, low humidity, and occasional dust storms creates specific challenges for car maintenance.

### Local Climate Considerations
- Average summer high: 100-110°F
- Extended heat periods: June through September
- Low humidity: 10-20%
- Frequent dust exposure
- Intense UV radiation

## Essential Pre-Summer Maintenance Checklist

### 1. Cooling System Service
*Critical for Mesquite's extreme temperatures*

- Check coolant level and condition
- Inspect hoses for cracks or bulges
- Test thermostat operation
- Clean radiator fins
- Check cooling fan operation
- Verify coolant concentration

> **Local Tip**: Mesquite's heat can cause coolant to degrade faster than usual. Consider a full cooling system flush every 30,000 miles or 2 years.

### 2. Battery Care
*Heat is particularly hard on batteries in our desert climate*

- Clean battery terminals
- Check voltage under load
- Inspect mounting security
- Test charging system
- Verify battery age (replace if over 3 years old)

### 3. Air Conditioning System
*Essential for Mesquite summers*

- Check refrigerant level
- Clean/replace cabin air filter
- Verify proper vent operation
- Test temperature output
- Inspect belts for wear

### 4. Tire Maintenance
*Critical for hot pavement conditions*

| Check Point | Frequency | Why It's Important |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Tire Pressure | Weekly | Heat increases pressure |
| Tread Depth | Monthly | Hot roads increase wear |
| Rotation | Every 5,000 miles | Ensure even wear |
| Balance | As needed | Prevent vibration |
| Alignment | Every 6 months | Extend tire life |

### 5. Fluid Levels and Conditions
*Heat accelerates fluid breakdown*

- Engine oil
- Power steering fluid
- Brake fluid
- Transmission fluid
- Windshield washer fluid
