## Tire Inspection Basics: What Every Driver Should Know

Proper tire maintenance is crucial for your safety and vehicle performance. Our mobile mechanics at MobileGreaser recommend checking your tires at least monthly and before any long trips.

### Essential Tire Inspection Tools
- Digital tire pressure gauge
- Tread depth gauge or penny
- Flashlight
- Safety equipment (gloves, reflective vest)

> **Pro Tip from MobileGreaser Mechanics**: "Always check tire pressure when tires are cold for accurate readings. Wait at least 3 hours after driving."

### Step-by-Step Tire Inspection Guide

1. **Check Tire Pressure**
   - Find recommended PSI (usually on driver's door jamb)
   - Remove valve cap carefully
   - Press gauge firmly on valve stem
   - Compare readings to manufacturer specs
   - Adjust pressure as needed

2. **Measure Tread Depth**
   - Use the penny test method
   - Insert penny with Lincoln's head down
   - If you see all of Lincoln's head, replace tire
   - Check multiple points across tread
   - Look for uneven wear patterns
